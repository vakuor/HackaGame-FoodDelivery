# HackaGame-FoodDelivery

Created by Vladislav vakuor Tkachev

## Getting started

This repository contains a very simple 2D game where you need to deliver food to programmers.  
Each match adds points, mismatch - vice versa.

It was made as a mini-game for website at the hackathon. Idea is simple. If you beat highscore on the website you will receive free points for some paid activities.
